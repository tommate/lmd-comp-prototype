# Easy single-page prototype

The goal is to upgrade the single page *index.html* to the latest Bootstrap version, using SCSS.


# Instructions

- Use Bootstrap 5.2.3, in Sass way

- **Use the minimum of Bootstrap @import. The final css file must be as light as possible**

- Avoid "style" HTML attribute, put the maximum of the SCSS code in styles.scss

- Excepted : inlined CSS so that the browser can display the logo and #intro, without loading the whole css file. This css file is loaded at the end of the HTML body. This optimizes page display.

- The resulting page must be responsive, as the original

- The old css is provided to help you
